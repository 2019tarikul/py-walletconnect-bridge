The initial flow is to connect the dapp with the mobile wallet using a QR code, and for the dapp to receive the public wallet addresses of the wallet.

=== Dapp:
. Selects a bridge server to use
. Requests a unique session token from the bridge server
. Generates a unique private key for this session
. Creates a pairing QR code which holds:
.. bridge server domain
.. unique session token
.. dapp's session private key
. Begins long-polling the bridge server for the connecting mobile wallet's details using the unique session token

=== Mobile wallet:
. Scans in the QR code
. Encrypts public wallet address(es) and its own public key with dapp's session private key
. Pushes following info to bridge:
.. unique session token
.. encrypted public wallet address(es)
.. wallet push server webhook (optional)
.. FCM token (optional)

The mobile wallet's FCM token is stored temporarily on the bridge server associated with the unique session token. The dapp never gains access to the wallet's FCM token.
