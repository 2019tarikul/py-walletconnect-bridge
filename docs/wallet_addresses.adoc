The initial flow is to connect the dapp with the mobile wallet using a QR code, and for the dapp to receive the public wallet addresses of the wallet.

. Dapp selects a bridge server to use and requests a unique session ID from the bridge server
. Bridge server generates a unique session ID, stores in Redis, and returns session ID
. Dapp generates a unique symmetric key for this session and creates a pairing QR code which holds:
.. bridge server domain
.. session ID
.. session symmetric key
. Dapp begins long-polling the bridge server for the connecting mobile wallet's details using the unique session ID
. After mobile wallet scans in the QR code, generates a nonce, encrypts public wallet address(es) with session symmetric key, authenticates the ciphertext and nonce and a message counter with the session symmetric key, then pushes the following info to the bridge server to be updated in Redis:
.. unique session ID
.. encrypted public wallet address(es)
.. nonce and message counter
.. HMAC hash
.. wallet push server webhook
.. wallet push notification token

The mobile wallet's push notification token is stored temporarily on the bridge server associated with the unique session ID. The dapp never gains access to the wallet's push notification token.
